This Guide covers the basics of guild interaction with Guild Chat, Guild Store and Guild Bank.

## 1. How to talk in Guild Chat

Every person in the game can belong to a maximum of 5 guilds.  The first task is to find out the numerical order of your guild that you want to chat with. \
Press G and then press the down arrow to the right of the displayed guild name. \

You will see an image similar to the above, depending on the number of guilds that you are a member of.  Note that St Elsweyr is in place 1, then Vis-deVis is in place 2 and St Greymoor is in place 3 and so on.  For our purposes let us say that we want to type in the guild chat of St Elsweyr. \
Go to your chat window and type /g1  (where 1 is the guild numerical order above) and press enter. \

The chat window will change to the corresponding guild like the following: \

When you see the name of the correct guild, you may start chatting with other members and will be able to see what they are saying to you.

## 2. How to use the Guild Bank
The guild bank may only be used to deposit either gold for donations or to deposit items for donations.  You will receive [[Guild Credits]] if you make donations. You may not make withdrawals from St. Elsweyr until such time that you might reach an appropriate rank that you would need to be appointed to.  This is customary for most trading guilds because large amounts of gold are stored in order to make weekly bids and valuable items are stored in which will be used to resell, for auctions or for awards and prizes.

First, you must go to a local bank in any city within any region in the game. \
Step up to the bank teller and press E to interact. You will have three choices: 
1. Open your own personal bank options 
2. Open the guild bank options 
3. Open the guild bank store options 

Most tellers are not this rude:

**Always check that you have the correct guild selected when choosing guild Bank or Store.**

When you select the guild bank, you will see the following:

1. To make an item deposit, select from your inventory and click the item to deposit it.
1. Click on R to deposit currency

## 3. How to use the Guild Store

When you have selected the guild store, you will see the following choices on the top right: **Browse**, **Sell**, or See your current **Listings**.

### Browse
When you are looking for an item to buy you will be browsing through all of the listings in the store.  If you know the name of the item you wish to purchase, you can type it in the search bar on the top left.  You may also browse through the categories as shown below by selecting a category and then click R to Start Search.  In this example the search was for a motif, which is consumable and all motifs are listed.  To continue through the pages, press next.

### Sell
You have 30 slots (also called listings) that you can fill to try to sell to another member or to anyone that visits our trader.  It is important for the well being of the guild store to try to keep your 30 slots filled at prices that are set to be reasonable.  When listing items to sell, your inventory will appear and you may choose the item and you set the price.

### Listings
This option will show you a detailed list of each item that you have listed in the store and the price that you listed it for. You may cancel a listing at any time, but the game charges a listing fee of 7% of the selling value, and this is not refunded. The guild does not make money from canceling or relisting an item.

You are charged 7% of the selling value. Meanwhile, **the guild only receives 3.49 percent of every sale.**

As the guild only receives a small fraction of what you are charged when an item sells, sales alone never pay for the cost of a trader. This is why every trading guild depends on donations and other revenues to exist.
