## Begin
You can begin NOW and the sooner the better.  Selling starts as easy as running around for a short time to pick up as many items as you can, like alchemy flowers, platinum, ore, etc. You can even fish if you have some bait.  When you are finished collecting, go to any bank. Pull the items out of your craft bag that you want to sell.  This is an important step because you will not be able to see these items when you are at the guild store unless they are in your regular inventory.

# Basic Tools & Tips

<!--**ESO+ Craft Bag:**-->

### How to list items in the store:
At the bank, press E to interact with the NPC banker. You will see options to use your own bank, your guild's bank and your guild's store. If you are in more than one guild, first decide which guild you want to sell from. Then select the store for that guild.  You will then see the options to search the store to look for things to buy, or to list items for sale or to look at all of your listings that are currently up for sale.  

Choose the “Sell” tab, which will bring up your inventory.  Click on the item, enter your price, and press E to list the item.  A default price will autofill - IGNORE this price.  It is an amount that any NPC  will give you and has no relation to the value of the item.  You have to pay a listing fee which is 1% of the item value, so make sure you have that much gold available. Each guild store gives you 30 slots for listening items to sell. 

> **TIP**:  It's important to keep all of your  slots filled and keep filling them as much as possible, for your sake and also for the guild. 

### Importance of Pricing
No one wants to pay too much for something they need but unfortunately a lot of people try to squeeze every penny they can get out of things they sell and then they wait . . . and wait . . . and wonder why it doesn’t sell.  The customers are over at the other guild buying things left and right because they THINK they are getting bargains.

Guilds in very good trading locations can sell your items almost as fast as you can list them if you price at a very good bargain.  However, there are  pros and cons to selling low.  You must be willing to ensure that you have enough items to continuously keep your store stocked and be willing to keep listing them every day.  People that sell millions usually fully stock their stores 2 to 4 times a day and that means having about 100 items to sell every day and that is a lot.  Not everyone has that much time to dedicate to selling or finding things to sell.

Every person needs to find a happy medium of how many items they can get and how often they can stock their stores and still have a lot of time to play the game.  

> **TIP**:  We believe in pricing according to how you can adequately manage your selling on a weekly basis.  Can you sell everyday, once a week or somewhere in between.  Accordingly, if you know the high and low price for an item, you should price it so that it will sell within your time frame.  It does take a little practice to tweak it to fit your style, but it can easily be done.

## Tools for Pricing: Sheets and Addons
There are several tools that can help you pick good prices for your items.  However, you need to be very familiar with the tools to fully utilize them.  
The easiest tool is to simply ask for a price check while in guild chat.  Right click on the item and select “link to chat”.  Your fellow guildies will respond with an answer.  However, this is not an ideal solution to use for every item you list.

The first very simple tool is a report that is made by the guild called the Sales lookup report.  It has limitations, but it has the advantage of being easy.  Just select the item you want to sell and it will list all sales made for the previous week and every price that it sold for.  This will give you the highs and lows of what was actually sold, but this report is not dynamic and can be up to a week behind on current prices.

The look up report can be found in discord under the category of Sales and then sales reports.  Here’s an example of St Elsweyr’s Sales lookup report:  [Final STE Sales Look Up 8/24/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BahnbbeHbUPSDaehM5iHxLMG2t_fIINeVF_Ku_TmFfY/edit?usp=sharing) \
Here's an example of St Greymoor’s Sales lookup report:[Final STG Sales Look Up 8/24/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSD6yXph6k4_pqrtPqmIUVrmzt7bYTA81MIR0ap4i0k/edit?usp=sharing) 

Next there are addons that not only provide you with help in pricing but they have additional features.
Master Merchant (MM) is an addon that provides very similar reports as the Guild Sales Lookup reports and the prices are also from ACTUAL amounts that have been sold.  We have a separate document that explains the [Master Merchant Setup](/wiki/Master-Merchant-Setup.md).

Another addon that is commonly used for pricing is called Tamriel Trade Centre (TTC).  It also has an independent website [www.tamrieltradecentre.com](http://www.tamrieltradecentre.com/)  where you can look items up to find a price or to find out where to find an item for sale.  Unlike MM, Tamriel Trade Centre shows you how many of the items are LISTED for sale in all the traders across Tamriel and how much they are listed for.  It is important to note that the prices shown are what the sellers are asking for and might be reasonable or may be way off base. 

Another addon that is considered outdated by some is Arkadius Trade Tools, but some really like this addon.  Just be sure to not run Arkadius and Master Merchant at the same time as they will override each other.

Before you consider adding an addon, first get a tool that will help you install, update, backup and uninstall addons for you.  This tool is called Minion and will make the addon process much more simple.  [https://minion.mmoui.com/?download](https://minion.mmoui.com/?download) 

## How to Sell and Ways to Sell

### Farming and Fishing
This is the process of collecting as many items of value as possible while you travel around Tamriel as quickly as possible. Seasoned players often develop routes that they repeat, but that takes some time to develop as you learn where items of value are located.  Discord has a category called Resources and a channel called resource-spots dedicated to generous members that have shared where they have found sources for various items.

We recommend that you have a map regardless if you farm or not.  The recommended addon for a map is Vultan’s Mini Map.
Another very important addon for farming is called Harvest Maps and is highly recommended for farming.  It will mark on your map all resources that you have found and you can create farming routes.  When combined with the Map Pins addon, it has filters to allow you to turn different resources on or off as you wish. 

> TIP:  Move as fast as you can, by using methods to increase your SPEED.  At a minimum, wear some jewelry with the Swift trait on them.  You can acquire the [Ring of the Wild Hunt](https://arzyelbuilds.com/ring-of-the-wild-hunt-guide-ring-of-the-wild-hunt-leads-location/) by doing Antiquities. It increases your movement speed by 45% while out of combat, which is huge!  You need 5 items to be able to create the Mythic ring. 

<!-->Location of the 5 pieces:
 - Greenshade - Symbol of Y'ffre - World Bosses
> - Grahtwood - Face of the Serpent - Elden Hollow Last Boss
> - Glenumbra - Band of Water - Public Dungeon Bosses Bad Man's Hallow
> - Malabal Tor - Face of the Wolf Beast - World Bosses
> - Murkmire - Charm of the Shapeless - World Bosses, Teeth of Sithis + Tsofeer Cavern Delves-->

Other gear that will help: [Fiord's Legacy](ESOsets link), [Jailbreaker](ESOsetslink)

Other helpful things could be in the champion points that you could assign to a character that is dedicated to farming:
To make resource farming more efficient on a node-by-node basis, put 75 [Champion Points](https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/Champion+System) into [The Lover](https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/The+Lover) constellation, which grants [Plentiful Harvest](https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/Plentiful+Harvest) and [Master Gatherer](https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/Master+Gatherer). The former gives you a 10% chance to harvest 100% more resources when gathering, while the latter cuts your gathering time by 50%. If you want to increase profits from treasure hunting and container looting, placing 75 CPs into [The Shadow](https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/The+Shadow) constellation will grant you the [Fortune Seeker](https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/Fortune+Seeker) and [Treasure Hunter](https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/Treasure+Hunter) perks, which will (respectively) net a 50% increase to all gold gain and an arbitrary increase to treasure chest loot quality.


The guild has an event called Farming Olympics, which is a great event to test your skills and learn some tips.  Watch for this event in discord Events/event-announcements.

## Crafting
There are two ways to sell using your maximized crafting skills.  
1. Crafting things like furnishings, glyphs, food, drink and potions and gear to sell.  

There is not much profit to be made in furnishings unless it is very rare or a brand new item in demand for a short time.  \
Other things like glyphs, food, drink, potions and gear can make small profits and may be the best way to start in crafting if you do not have multiple crafting characters. Always study the history of what sells and for how much before you choose to craft.

2.  Create multiple crafting characters and do all seven daily writs and all surveys that you get from this.  This method is our recommendation.
If you do daily crafting writs, you will get occasional gold mats, ornate items to resell and occasional surveys that will give you more raw materials per node than normal.
With only one character crafting daily, the amounts that  you can make are meager, but               much more can be made by having multiple characters crafting daily writs.
> TIP:  Having multiple characters that do daily crafting writs will increase the gold you make and give you more gold mats and materials to sell.
>For example:  I have 18 additional characters that each do daily crafting.  On average, it takes 2 minutes to do all 7 crafting writs (enchanting, jewelry, clothing, provisioning, blacksmithing, woodworking and alchemy) per character.  With screen loading times, it takes approximately one hour per day to do the writs for all 18 characters.  In exchange for one hour of my time every day, I usually make 4 to 5 million per week which is all profit less the store taxes:
> - $600,000 gold for doing the writs
> - $35,000 in jewelry intricates and ornates sold in the guild store
> - About 80 glyphs that I deconstruct to get the materials or help other players level
> - Approximately 75 Master Writs to sell or utilize to get more valuables to sell
> - $3 Million in gold mats sold in the guild store from crafting only
> - $1 to 2 Million in gold mats sold in the guild store from refining raw materials from surveys.
> - Enough refined materials to pay for the cost of crafting the writs each day.
> - Plus I gain 2 XP points every day just for crafting if I use basic XP scrolls.
> This assumes all crafters are at a minimum of CP160 and have fully leveled each crafting skill to the maximum of 50 points.

Not all people can afford to dedicate one hour every day and that is fine but this gives you a base point on how to calculate your time and associated sales and profits.

> Tip: Invaluable addons for daily crafting are Dolgubon’s Lazy Writ Crafter, CraftStore, Potion Maker and ESO Master Recipe List.

Speed is another convenience in crafting to minimize your time to craft and collect materials from the surveys.  Using the [Ring of the Wild Hunt](https://arzyelbuilds.com/ring-of-the-wild-hunt-guide-ring-of-the-wild-hunt-leads-location/) is invaluable in this.


Champion point allocation is also very important to help increase your odds in refining and collecting.  Alcast has an excellent site for teaching you how to do daily writs https://alcasthq.com/eso-crafting-writs-guide/ and also has advice on assigning 
champion points.

Crafting Certification:
1. Once you reach lvl 6 see Millenith, Danel Telleno, and Felarian to start the quests to begin your certification Millenith can certify you in Blacksmithing, Clothier and Woodworking and can be found in the Fighters Guild in your starting city based on your alliance. Danel can cerfify you in Enchanting, Alchemy and Provisioning and is located in your starter city at the Mages Guild. Felarian can cerfify you in Jewelry at level 7 and is located outside the crafting district in the city of Alinor, in Summerset. 

Alliance Starting Cities:
	   1. for Aldmeri Dominion Pact - Auridon (Vulkhel Guard)
       2. for Daggerfall Pact- Davon's Watch
  	   3. for Ebonheart Pact- Deshaan   

## Gear Delving
Sellable gear can be obtained by defeating world bosses, delves, dolmens and public dungeons.  However, the trick is to find the set and pieces that are most valuable.  If you have not reached level CP160 yet, this is not the best way to try to make gold.  There is very little demand for gear less than this level.

- Delve bosses have a chance to drop a waist or feet set piece from the zone they are located in.
- Overland group bosses have a 100% chance to drop head, chest, legs, or weapon set piece from the zone they are located in.
- Public dungeon bosses have a chance to drop a shoulder, hand, or weapon set piece from the zone they are located in.
- Treasure Chests gained from defeating a Dark Anchor have a 100% chance to drop a ring or amulet set piece from the zone they are located in.
- Each boss also has a small chance to drop a unique set piece. Unique pieces are always blue quality.
Overland sets drop quality varies from green to purple.

Valuable Overland Sets are variable depending on trends, game updates and trends. Some examples include
* Mother’ Sorrow - Deshaan 
* Briarheart - Wrothgar

Find the trending sets per websites that stay on top of game updates like Alcast,Skinnycheeks, Liko, Dots, etc. Be sure to look at PVP meta builds on these sites also.  

> Tip: Pay attention to trends!  The game is constantly changing specifications which can affect  the gear and value.

Traits are a reasonable consideration also:
* Divine for PVE
* Impenetrable and well-fitted for PVP

Theory crafting ESO by Jinks in his discord server is a good source of trending PVP gear sets. https://discord.gg/6j4zTkzV \
ESOU has a good game theory, build and detail explanations https://discord.gg/esou \
> Tip: If a dungeon is empty, chances are the drops are not that valuable.

## Thieving
Tip:  The best way to maximize your efficiency as a criminal in ESO is to pursue and completely fill out your Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and Legerdemain skill lines. Here are the most important skills you can take:

* Trafficker (Legerdemain): Allows you to sell and launder additional goods, up to 180% of the default value (at Rank IV), equating  to 140 total sales and 140 total launders per day.
* Light Fingers (Legerdemain): Increases the chance of successfully pickpocketing an NPC, up to a 50% increase (at Rank IV).
* Locksmith (Legerdemain): Increases your odds of picking a lock, up to 70% (at Rank IV).
* Scales of Pitiless Justice (Dark Brotherhood): Decreases Bounty after picking a lock, up to 70% (at Rank IV), and Heat from a witnessed murder or assault by up to 50% (at Rank IV).
* Padomaic Sprint (Dark Brotherhood): Makes you move up to 30% faster for 12 seconds after you assassinate an NPC (at Rank IV).
* Haggling (Thieves Guild): Gives you up to 10% in increased profits from fenced items (at Rank IV).
* Clemency (Thieves Guild): Adds a dialogue option to temporarily let you off the hook with guards if you are accosted by one.  Lasts for 1 minute.  Only works once per day.
* Swiftly Forgotten (Thieves Guild): (At Rank IV) makes Bounty disappear at a rate of 115 every 3 minutes and makes Heat disappear at a rate of 64 every 3 minutes.
* Dark Stalker (Vampirism): Lets you ignore movement speed penalty while sneaking. Also lets you enter stealth 50% more quickly at night.




## Flipping
Flipping is the process of purchasing items at a given price (usually lower than market value) and then subsequently re-selling these same items for more, resulting in a net gain in gold.
> TIP: This is an advanced method of selling and is not recommended for beginners just learning to sell.

Flipping takes money to make money.  It requires a good knowledge of the market and prices.  It always has the risk of losing money if you are not careful.  It takes time to travel from one location to the next searching for bargains.  However, it can provide profits if you are wise to the ways.

Chances are you are likely not going to be finding very many items for under market price at the major trading hubs in ESO. In order to compete with the convenience and endless supply of items that the elite traders in these major trading cities have to offer, often times sellers that are in smaller trading guilds in less convenient locations will list their items below market price in order to entice customers to go out of their way to visit their trader.  Zone purchasing is another option, but to avoid potential scams, always do transactions by trading in person, face to face, and do NOT use the mail system, even COD.

Some people find that using addons such as Master Merchant and Awesome Guild Store will help them while searching for discounted items. These addons provide useful charts and data that indicate the worth of any particular item, and even it’s percentage over or under market price and can help identify a deal on the spot.
