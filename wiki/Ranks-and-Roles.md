## Ranks

See [Guild Handbook](Guild-Handbook.md) for a description of rankings.
<!--([ranking description obtained from here](Step-by-Step-Guide.md))-->

<!--
Ranks are calculated based on Fair Share. Each guild has a different Fair Share because the trader costs are significantly different. Your growth and progression to each new rank is based on your total INCOME that you earn and can be a combination of several things: Sales (the total of which the guild takes 3.5%), Gold Donations, Item Donations, Lottery ticket purchases, and credits for jobs done for the guild. 

St Elsweyr Fair Share is $25,000 of income per member\
St Greymoor Fair Share is $20,000 of income per member\
St Blackwood Fair Share is $15,000 of income per member

Page: Achieving a total income of <25% of Fair Share in one week \
Squire: <50% of Fair Share \
Crusader: <75% of Fair Share \
Knight: 75-100% of Fair Share

As new members come into the guild, the Pages are removed first by the lowest Fair Share percent less than 25%.  Pages that have reached 25% or greater are promoted to a Squire.  Squires that have reached 50% or greater are promoted to Crusaders, and Crusaders that have reached 75% are promoted to Knights.  Please note that you can be demoted if you fall below these percentages.  However, once you have reached the status of Knight, your income history is weighted into the percent and you will have more leeway before being demoted. 

Higher ranks for established members are achievable for those that choose to excel to the rank of Paladin or the ultimate status of Lord.-->
