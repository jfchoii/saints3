## How is Our Crown Exchange Done?

Anyone in St Elsweyr, St Greymoor, and St Blackwood can buy and sell crowns on the [#crown-exchange channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/585172092119547925/761049495114612767)! However, all crown exchange transactions by our guild members must be brokered by an approved Broker. This is to keep our Crown Exchange scam-free!

Remember, failure to use a Broker when conducting a Crown Exchange transaction through the guild will result in the loss of your ability to Buy or Sell Crowns through our program for 30 days. Continued violations of this rule can result in permanent loss of Buying or Selling privileges.

As ZoS does not allow direct exchange of crowns itself, crown exchange can only occur via Sellers buying a specific item from the Crown Store and gifting said item to the Buyer. 

Each Crown Exchange transaction will incur a 5% tax – 2% of this goes to the Broker and 3% will go to the guild.

To ensure that the Crown Exchange remains scam-free for our guild members, Brokers will first confirm that the Buyer’s order request is accurate, and the rate agreed upon for the exchange is correct. Buyers will then trade their gold with the Broker, who will hold on to the gold until it is confirmed that the Seller has gifted the agreed item and that the Buyer has received it. Once received, Brokers will then trade 95% of the gold received to the Sellers.

## BUYERS 

To buy crowns through our guild, first determine which item you would like to buy from the Crown Store. Please note that items that are discounted for ESO Plus members will not be discounted when gifted to another player, even if both Buyer and Seller are ESO Plus members (this is a limitation by ZoS). Players are also unable to gift items that cost Crown Gems (another limitation by ZoS).

To place an order, go to the #crown-exchange channel. Please scroll up and read the message, including what the current range of what the exchange rates are. 

Our guild sets a competitive range of rates that Buyers may choose (any rate between the range is acceptable but must not be higher or lower than the range set by the guild). Use the following format to request a Crown Exchange order: 

> @Exchange @Broker Ezabi the Banker / 5,000 crowns / 5,000,000 gold/ @buyername (rate 1000:1) 

Note: Needs text color formatting 

This format can be understood as follows: 
- @Exchange - **This sends out a message to all crown sellers that a request has been posted 
- @Broker - **This sends out a message to all brokers that a request has been posted 
- Ezabi the Banker **-  This is the item being requested from the buyer 
- 5,000 crowns **-  This is the amount of crowns that the item costs 
- 5,000,000 gold **-  This is the gold value of the item (Total crowns X Exchange Rate) 
- @buyername  **-  This is the name of the buyer that wants to purchase the item & has posted the request 
- (rate 1000:1) **-  This is the rate of exchange that will be used*** 

*Remember to put your rate at the _end_ of the request so that it’s easier for the Broker to confirm the right amount and rate.*

Note: The reserved words @Exchange and @Broker will send a notification to interested parties that a new order has been placed.

Sellers will pick up your order request by reacting with the Seller emote to the order request. You may reach out to Sellers by either a DM (Direct Message) or @sellername on the [# appointments](https://discordapp.com/channels/585172092119547925/854085490638979092) channel to arrange a time convenient to both of you so that the Crown Exchange may occur.

Buyers and Sellers may negotiate a different rate for the Crown Exchange as long as the rate is not higher or lower than the range set by the Guild.

Important:  If the Buyer and Seller agree on a different rate from the one posted, **please update your discord request with the new rate before completing the transaction**.

Under extenuating circumstances, if a Buyer and/or Broker is unable to get hold of the original Seller for more than 24 hours to communicate arranging a time to meet for a time limited item, the Buyer reserves the right to either delete the request and re-posting it at a different rate (if they think this will make it more attractive to other Sellers, given the time limit) or to accept the offer of another Seller after the 24 hours.  It is common courtesy to inform the original Seller of the change via DM.

Once the Buyer and Seller have agreed on a time, they may request a Broker on the [#crown-chat](https://discordapp.com/channels/585172092119547925/809141183548358667) channel or ask for one on the guild chat in-game.  Sometimes, a Broker may approach the Buyer and Seller to arrange a time for the Crown Exchange transaction to occur.

After your order is completed, please **DO NOT delete** your order request!  Head to the [#buyer-feedback](https://discordapp.com/channels/585172092119547925/761056372280000513) channel to post your feedback for your transaction. 


## SELLERS 

**To sell crowns, please go to the #crown-exchange channel and scroll up to the top of the page. Please prioritize selling crowns to guild members who have posted earlier (and therefore have waited longer) and those who are buying items that are time limited, where the items are only in the Crown Store for a limited time and will be indicated by the :clock: emote that Brokers will put on the order request.

Please tag the order request you wish to fulfill by reacting with the Seller emote. Once you do, you may reach out to the Buyer via DM or by their @ name on the #appointments channel to arrange a time convenient to both of you. 

If you tag a request that is available for a limited time only (indicated by the CLOCK emote), kindly ensure that you will be available (preferably within 24 hours of accepting the request) to at least respond to the Buyer and/or Broker to arrange a time to do the crown exchange. The crown exchange transaction can occur outside of this 24 hour (if the item isn't due to expire by then) but at least be available to communicate with the Buyer and/or Broker within that time. 

As common courtesy, Sellers should not double tag a request and move on to tag other requests, starting with the oldest post that you can afford, or a time limited one. However, if a Buyer and/or Broker is unable to get hold of the original Seller for more than 24 hours for a time limited item, the Buyer reserves the right to either delete the request and re-posting it at a different rate (if they think this will make it more attractive to other Sellers, given the time limit) or to accept the offer of another Seller.

Once you have agreed on a time, both of you may request for a Broker from the [#crown-chat channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/585172092119547925/809141183548358667) or via guild chat in-game.

You may choose to pick up multiple order requests but please ensure that you have sufficient crowns to fulfill all crown sales.


## BROKERS 

Anyone with the @Broker tag can broker Crown Exchange transactions for our guild.  Do not attempt to do an exchange without a broker present. \

All Brokers will receive a 2% commission for every Crown Exchange transaction brokered.

If you would like to be trained as a Broker, please send a message to  @cookstagames, the Crown Exchange officials. Training is easy and any guild member is welcomed to train!

## FAQ

**_I have read the rules, but I still have questions, what do I do?_** \
If you have any questions, feel free to message @cookstagames, your friendly Crown Exchange officials or post your questions on the #crown-chat channel! Any suggestions are welcome too!

**_I’m not interested in anything to do with Crown Exchange. How do I stop getting notifications for this part of the server?_** \
Everyone has the role of @Exchange. Turn off this role to stop receiving messages from Crown Exchange. If you cannot change this role yourself, just ask any officer (you can ask on #crown-chat) and they can turn it off for you.

**_What does the rate ranges mean?_** \
Buyers can post their request to buy an item from the Crown Store and calculate the rate of gold:crown exchange based on the range of rate our guild has set. For example, if the current rate range is 800:1 to 900:1, Buyers may choose to request an item for a range anywhere between 800:1 to 900:1, such as 875:1, or at any rate they can afford. 

**_Why is the rate range higher for requests to buy Houses?_** \
Houses have always been more expensive, even when purchased through the Crown Store. Since our guild rates are always lower than other major crown exchange sites, and since it costs a lot more to purchase a House, this is an extra incentive for Sellers to part with their hard-earned cash-bought Crowns to get you the Tamriel house of your dreams!

**_I really want to buy crowns urgently. Can I just post on main chat or advertise on different channels or post my request with a rate higher than the range set by the Guild?_** \
We’re thankful that you’d like to buy crowns through our guild’s Crown Exchange! Our guild aims to keep the rate as reasonable as possible – and although the rates may rise and fall, our rates are always lower than the rates offered by other major crown exchange sites. If you choose to post at a rate higher than the ones our guild sets, this might become a slippery slope where only requests with abnormally high rates are filled. In our guild, we’d like everyone to have a fair chance! We thank you for your understanding and patience!

**_I posted a request to buy an item that is available only for a limited time, but no Seller has picked up my request. What should I do?_** \
Please see the question just above this one. Also, as the Buyer, you reserve the right to edit your request to a different rate that you think might be more attractive to Sellers. If you happen to find a crown Seller outside of the Guild (please be careful as scams can and do happen) you can choose to delete your existing request, if your request has been fulfilled elsewhere.

**_A Seller has agreed to sell me crowns for a time limited item, but I have been having trouble contacting them to arrange a time to complete the Crown Exchange transaction. What should I do?_** \
Please reach out to the Broker (if there's one already attached to the transaction) or to myself @cookstagames to see how we can help. Otherwise, do your best to contact the Seller either via DM'ing them, or contacting them on either the #  appointments channel or the #  crown chat channel on Discord, and if you don't hear back from them for more than 24 hours, you may reserve the right to delete the request and reposting them (whether with the existing rates or at a higher rate to make your request more attractive, if you so wish) in hopes of getting another Seller. Please kindly inform the original Seller of this change via DM. Should the original Seller get back to you before you find another Seller and both of you are happy and able to arrange a time and go ahead with the transaction, you may choose to do so. 

**_Do we really need a Broker for every Crown Exchange transaction?_** \
Our Brokers have been properly trained to ensure that each Crown Exchange transaction not only goes smoothly and without a hitch, but to also ensure that the transaction is safe and handled correctly so that no Buyer or Seller in our guild gets scammed. We are scam-free and will remain scam-free, as long as everyone follows the rules, the guild will guarantee the transaction.

**_I am so impressed with my Seller/Broker that I’d like to tip them on top of their commission! Can I do that?_** \
Tips are 100% optional and are never required for Crown Exchange transactions. Don’t forget to leave your feedback on the #buyer-feedback channel to let your Seller and Broker know how much you appreciate them!

**_My Buyer has given me an extra tip to share between the Seller/Broker. What should I do?_** \
Tips are yours to share how you wish and you don’t need to report this to the guild for taxes. Enjoy your tip and keep up the fantastic work!

**_I want to train as a Broker! What do I need to do?_** \
Please message @shepsters or @Shahzade, the Crown Exchange officials, and they will start training you on how to be a Broker!
