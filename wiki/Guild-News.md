## Monster Lottery
(2/6/2024)\
You have until trader flip on Tuesdays to purchase your tickets. Tickets are 1000g each and you can buy as many as you want. Just make a donation to the guild bank of your choice ending in 1. It must end in 1 to count as a ticket! 

So, for example, if you want to buy 50 tickets, you donate 50,001g to the guild bank!

## Trader Flip
Trader flip occurs every Tuesday at 3:00 pm EST or EDT depending on  daylight savings time.  Every week, guilds must place blind bids and wait until this time to find out if they got a trader.  It is commonly called Trader Flip because this is when Guildâ€™s traders can change locations and flip around.   

Here we have a picture of several members hanging around our traders to see if we won our bids.  It is also announced in guild chat.
