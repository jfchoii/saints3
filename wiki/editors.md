> For Editors: You can edit the markdown files directly in the github.com interface without having to install anything, but do not change the filenames. 
> 
> For now, either click the Edit button in the upper right or navigate to <https://github.com/jfchoii/saints3/tree/master/wiki> and open the .md file of interest. You can then edit it by clicking the :pencil: icon in the upper right side. This uses the Markdown format employed by Jekyll.

**Don't change any filenames. This will break links until I can soft-code permanent links, if necessary.**

For more complicated edits, I will post a guide explaining how to make a branch and merge branches for those unfamiliar with Github. Right now, removing pages/creating new pages is discouraged as I have to figure out the linking and provide a github guide, but I highly encourage reducing the number of pages by combining the contents into one page. \

Access site at <shttps://jfchoii.github.io/saints3> ; Access the editable wiki pages at <https://github.com/jfchoii/saints3/blob/master/wiki/>

This may be the home for static information related to the guild. Information that is constantly updated may be links to sheets/docs.

# Suggested merges: 

Similar documents: 
- Guild Rules, Absences - merge absences into guild rules
- Guild Handbook, Performance Guidelines, Guild Credits, ranks in ranks and roles - merge all into guild handbook (then change ranks and roles into a list of officers)
- rewrite step by step guide into a general intro for guild handbook and remove step by step guide (Step... also includes a description of progression)
- Link Guild News to a static google sheets w/ rankings, lotteries, etc.

# Big tasks that needs help

Title: Image wrangler \
Task: Downloading images used in google docs
1. Download images from the Google Docs 
2. To easily link to them within the file, rename the image to an easily copied name following document-number.jpg (example: mastermerchantsetup-1.jpg)
3. Place the images into the assets folder. If there are many, I suggest making its own folder. (the master merchant setup guide has many images so it may have its own folder.)
4. Editor or image wrangler will link to image within markdown document using '[alt text](image url)' syntax. (For example, '[addon setup](addon-1.jpg)')

Title: Text wrangler \
Task: Updating outdated information in posts & merging redundant information (Preferably a GM or Officer does this)

# Planned edits:
1. Import contents of Google docs into wiki
   - missing: Rite, Guild Home, Discord Overview
2. Edit text so it is less verbose and easier to read. 
   - Also see suggested merges
3. **(Need help with this)** Compile all images, rename and upload files to assets folder for linking in the pages. Also, the logo is currently a screenshot.
4. (Optional) Restructure documentation to emphasize trading help and assistance (addons, pricing, farming, flipping, crafting, etc)
5. (Optional) Find hosting so that we don't have to use the current URL
6. (Optional) Hype up the guild lottery & rewards for donations
7. (Optional) Find a way to make this document more private. Otherwise, more private info may be linked as static google docs.(Guild News)

Note: this format doesn't like it when headers aren't in order, (aka # then ## then ###) it breaks the table of contents (when # is followed by ### for example)

Accomplished tasks
