> For Editors: You can edit the markdown files directly in the github.com interface without having to install anything, but do not change the filenames. For now, either click the Edit button in the upper right or navigate to <https://github.com/jfchoii/saints3/tree/master/wiki> and open the .md file of interest. You can then edit it by clicking the :pencil: icon in the upper right side. This uses the Markdown format employed by Jekyll.

**Don't change any filenames. This will break links until I can soft-code permanent links, if necessary.**

For more complicated edits, I will post a guide explaining how to make a branch and merge branches for those unfamiliar with Github.Right now, removing pages/creating new pages is discouraged as I have to figure out the linking and provide a github guide, but I highly encourage reducing the number of pages by combining the contents into one page. \

Access site at <shttps://jfchoii.github.io/saints3> ; Access the editable wiki pages at <https://github.com/jfchoii/saints3/blob/master/wiki/>

This may be the home for static information related to the guild. Information that is constantly updated may be links to sheets/docs.

Planned and suggested edits:
1. Import contents of Google docs into wiki
   - missing: Rite, Guild Home, Performance Guidelines, Discord Overview
2. Edit text so it is less verbose and easier to read. 
   - Remove redundancies, consolidate step by step guide, guild basics, ranks and roles, performance guidelines?
   - Guild Handbook and Rules may be redundant? 
   - Absences being separate from rules might be redundant but might also be OK because people might ask a lot
   - Emphasize contributions
3. **(Need help with this)** Compile all images, rename and upload files to assets folder for linking in the pages. Also, the logo is currently a screenshot.
4. (Optional) Restructure documentation to emphasize trading help and assistance (addons, pricing, farming, flipping, crafting, etc)
5. (Optional) Find hosting so that we don't have to use the current URL
6. (Optional) Hype up the guild lottery & rewards for donations
7. (Optional) Find a way to make this document more private. Otherwise, more private info may be linked as static google docs.(Guild News)

Note: this format doesn't like it when headers aren't in order, it breaks the table of contents.

Accomplished tasks
1. Find a nice theme 
2. Restore formatting where relevant (Like in [[Crown Exchange]], for example)
