## Overview
This document describes the different types of game knowledge that is often requested by guild members when asking for help.  The game and its mechanics can get complex at times, therefore it is unlikely anyone will be able to provide expert level assistance without referring to jobs aids.  This document provides a list of key game mechanics and some suggestions on where to go for updated information on them for different playstyles.  

It is also important to note that players come in a range of different playstyles, so when providing game advice, it is first important to understand their game goals and playstyle before providing recommendations.  For example, a progression meta would be completely inefficient if the player mostly played solo or PVP, etc.  Also worth noting is that players have vastly different time commitments to the game and ability or willingness to understand the intricacies of the game.  Essentially, it is important to note whether or not they are a casual gamer or have end game goals.


## Game mechanics, builds and more

Several sites already describe game mechanics very well.

* [ESO University: Main](https://eso-u.com/) - probably the best guide for game mechanics and build advice available.  Great reviews on new sets as well.
* [The Elder Scrolls Online - All About Mechanics Series!](https://xynodegaming.com/guides/allaboutmechanics/) - great site for dungeon, arena and trial mechanics.  Also has great non meta build ideas.
* [Hack The Minotaur - MMO & RPG Game Guides, Builds & News](https://www.hacktheminotaur.com/) - has a little of everything.  I also like Hack’s non meta build ideas.  
* [Dottz Gaming - Video Game Guides and Gameplay](https://dottzgaming.com/) - one of my favorites.  Dottz has some great PVE and PVP build ideas, cover mechanics and strategies well.
* [Deltia's Gaming -](https://deltiasgaming.com/) another source for builds and game advice
* [AlcastHQ Homepage. ESO Builds & Guides - AlcastHQ](https://alcasthq.com/) - has everything.  Probably most popular ESO site.  Mostly meta based build ideas, but nonetheless, great source of ideas and game knowledge.
* https://discord.gg/4kuY2V5R - Theorycrafting discord site.  Great source of info with many active members offering help in a constructive way about builds and mechanics
* https://discord.gg/zKGqV4nJ - ESO discord site.  I use primarily for server status and PTS notes.

### Set and skill resources
* [ESO - Skillbook | ESO-SkillBook](https://eso-skillbook.com/) - Go to site for comprehensive skill explanations.
* [ESO-Sets | Elder Scrolls Online Sets](https://eso-sets.com/) - Best site for set descriptions.

### PVP builds
* [The Real Godzilla](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk7HIuVjHPLzqikp2h-ETCA) - Great youtube based site.  Some of the best PVP build recommendations I’ve seen.
* [Unified Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCorbta-fAHKJcxJ6ExbtPwg) - Great builds, mostly for PVP.  Site includes a lot of New World videos as well.
* [KristoferESO](https://www.kristofereso.com/) - Builds include a nice rating scale to help you determine what may work best for you.

### Parses (and more build ideas) - also great sources for PTS test results
* [Liko](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuLGCNYH1t5DyQQ5tfU4Hdw) - great site for build and parses
* [Skinny Cheeks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9DsGeMufUbCTYQT0dPFZhA) - another great site for build and parses

### Intro Videos
* [ESO Character Build Checklist (Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3xFK4Z0Qc) - Great into video by Dottz
* [How to do a DPS Parse & Optimize Your Damage in ESO](https://dottzgaming.com/eso-guides/general/how-to-do-a-dps-parse-optimize-your-damage/) - Great video by Dottz to help increase DPS

## Addons
* [Elder Scrolls Online AddOns](https://www.esoui.com/addons.php) - site with list of all ESO addons with download instructions and dependencies.  
* [Minion - Premier AddOn Management](https://minion.mmoui.com/) - Minion download link
* [Must Have ESO Addons - Alcast's ESO Addons List](https://alcasthq.com/eso-alcast-addon-list/) - Good overview and recommended addons

### Trading Addons
List other trading addons here \
[[Master Merchant Setup]]

### My Addons
These are the addons I use regularly.  Note the greyed out addons are not relevant for this character (e.g. ShalkTracker is Warden specific).  Also, I often use only a portion of an addon if there are better features from another addon.  To use similar addons (e.g. addons PVP alerts), simply disable the portion of the addon that you are not using in the settings menu.  If you do not do so, you will either get conflict errors or a lot of overlapping screen or chat messages.
