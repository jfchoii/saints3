Absences of more than one week should be reported to an officer of the guild.  Extended absences are not allowed for members in orientation or on the removal list.  We ask that you make a donation appropriate to cover your period of absence.

## Inactivity Policy
After you have exceeded the inactivity period, you will be removed from the guild. 

Prior notice will not be given.  You may however receive an invite from a sister guild.

If you have been removed from any guild, you are not restricted from re-applying to the same guild or to a sister guild. 

## Donations

We ask that you **make a donation in advance when you will be gone**.  The guild loses more than 20k per week when you are gone or do not make any sales.  You may otherwise be removed if you do not inform anyone or cover your absence with a donation.

## Extension/Transfers

If your real life situation demands that you cannot be active in the game, please let the GM know and arrangements will be made to help you and to protect the guild.

## Reinstatement

If you have been removed from any guild and find that your circumstances have changed, you may reapply to the guild that you were removed from.

Our trading guilds maintain your historical sales and income data.  If you leave and rejoin, you will be reinstated at the same ranking as when you left.  To avoid losing rank, when you know that you will be inactive for more than two weeks, we advise that you leave the guild as soon as possible so that you will not lose rank during your period of inactivity.  You will be invited to return.
