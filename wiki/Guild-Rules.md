## VIOLATION OF GUILD RULES OR GUILD REQUIREMENTS IS GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL.

## Rules are made because of the few.

<!--:warning: EN: I propose splitting this into
1. Guild house rules (everything for discord, ranks, )
2. Trade
3. Absences (Consolidate with absences document)

Also see [[Absences]] and [[Sales Handbook]]

(Editor's comment: Isn't this in the handbook?)-->

## DA RULES 
1. Have Fun
   - Real life has enough challenges. We play the game to have fun and we should never lose sight of that. 
1. Respect The Rules
   - The rules apply to everyone and they are enforced. \
   - We wish we did not have to have rules and hope that someday we can throw them away, but until  that day: Learn them, respect them and enforce them. 
   - We enforce the Zenimax Code of Conduct https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/code-of conduct AND only use language that is used in the game dialog.
1. Mind Your Manners 
   - Be respectful, don’t demand anything or beg by asking members for free items and remember to say please and thank you. Treat and be treated with kindness and respect for each other. Remember this is just a game, but the players are real people. 
1. Manage Conflict  
   - 500, 1,000 or 1,500  friends can never avoid having a disagreement about something at some point in time.  However, you can agree to disagree and you can control how you express yourself and keep it  private. However, there are some actions that cannot be excused and for those instances, we  want you to report such actions to any officer. Please try to manage conflict by taking the challenge to find the good in all people and tell them what you found.

   - Our community is friendly, kind, helpful and drama free with true guild spirit.  We expect that you will contribute to this great environment and avoid any derogatory behavior and comments.  Please do not subject yourself or others to gossip or attempt to influence other members to  agree with you. We all have a right to our own opinion and unless asked, keep yours private.
1. Guild Chat AND Discord Channels  
   - Guild chat and open Discord channels are always open for anyone to use and see. When  you use it, you are representing yourself AND the guild. Be positive, friendly and helpful  The reputation of the guild depends on you. In short – Be an adult. This list is not all inclusive and we reserve the right to revise it to  meet the needs of the guild at our discretion. 
   - Avoid all controversial subjects on religion, politics, sex, or race.
   - Do not use socially offensive language. We use the same language as you see in the dialogs within the game. No foul language.
   - No drama please – it drives people away from you.
   - No begging, bullying or harassment.
   - Do not use guild communications to bypass the guild store.
   - No posts or uploads of obscene material.
   - Do not dominate the guild chat. Take turns – it is shared by 500 members. Take it to a private conversation either by private message in discord, group chat or whisper in game
   - Do not use Discord or in-game guild chat to sell or promote your real-life ventures, projects, products or to promote yourself on social media platforms (i.e.: YouTube, Twitter, eyc.). It’s OK to share your social media profiles among each other - just please do not use our guilds to build your following.
   - Do use the chat or Discord to reach out for help 
   - Do use the chat or Discord to help other members in need. 
   - Do use the chat or Discord to have friendly open conversations. 
   - Do use the chat or Discord to find friends
   - Do use the chat or Discord to participate in guild events
   - Do laugh, tell jokes, be funny, make people laugh, have fun! 
   - Discord Voice is not required, but certain guild events will require you to be in Discord and capable of hearing and understanding English. No one can explain all mechanics of a dungeon or trial by typing in chat and still play their role. You are not required to talk, but you must be able to listen to the event leader to participate.
1. Sell in the Guild Store
   - You are in a trading guild, we know that you make a little less money by selling in the guild store over direct sales to other players, but the guild provides sales volume that you cannot acquire by any other means in the game.  We cannot control or monitor your decisions to sell all of your items in the guild store, however, we do enforce that no items are advertised for sale within guild communication channels such as guild chat and discord.
   - We ask for your generosity in helping to support your guild be successful and that includes selling in the guild’s store.  The guild tax is 7% and we do not regulate that as it is fixed by the game.  We do NOT get the 7%, the game only gives the guild 3.5% of sales and that is NOT enough to pay for the guild trader each week.
   - We depend on your generosity to make donations to help keep us sustainable.  It is not a requirement and is entirely voluntary.  We just hope that you will remember that the guilds do need your support. 
1. Remember Your Value  
   - As your character advances in rank, you are learning valuable tips and tricks that other new  members could benefit from. Your knowledge has great value to others and to the guild. Share  your knowledge, become a leader, remember that simple things are often difficult to a beginner. Just as someone has probably helped you in the game at some point, we believe in paying it  forward.  Be a hero and help another member.
   - If you are a new player and want to level up, please don’t expect someone to do the work for you and try to just go along for the ride.  Do NOT ask anyone to do this.  Of course you may ask for assistance, but openly tell your level before asking.  
1. DON’T Get Kicked  
   - The members and the guild want you to stay, so please keep in compliance with the rules or you will be removed. If you have a significant “real life” situation that prevents you from temporarily playing or participating, be sure to contact us to report your absence. However, the best way to  secure your position or rank in the guild is to make contributions that will keep you in good  standing during your absence. Your contact options always include contacting officers by in-game mail or on Discord. If you know that you will be inactive for more than two weeks we advise you to let an officer know of your situation and voluntarily remove yourself from the guild if you do not make an appropriate donation for your absence.  All members in good standing will be re-invited back upon return to the game and your history will be saved.
   - A member can be kicked in the following ways, but please do not put yourself or us in the  position of having to kick anyone. 
     - Not complying with the rules or the Zenimax Code of Conduct. 
     - Inactivity and/or inability to contact you or lack of response from you. Inactivity is defined as not playing the game or setting your *status to offline for two weeks unless prior arrangements are made.
     - Trading Guilds also require an income level above the bottom 5% of  all members. 
     - Causing too much drama, agitation, negativity or irritation to other members. 
     - Stalking any player. 

*Note: Do not leave your status in-game as “OFFLINE”, as the roster will report you as being inactive in  the game. Do not let your mailboxes get full and be unable to receive important  messages. Do not ignore messages, warnings or whispers from any authority from the guilds. 

Sometimes mistakes happen (even by ZOS) and if you were kicked while in good standing, chances are that it was a mistake. Please contact someone and you will receive an invite - **all of your history is maintained in our databases and you will be completely reinstated along with your history**. If you do end up being kicked from the guild, a prior member with a positive and an active history will always have priority in returning to us.
