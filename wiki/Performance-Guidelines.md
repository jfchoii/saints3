## Measuring Performance
We are not like most guilds.  We set the standards low and hope you will overachieve.  We don’t have any requirements - except stay out of the bottom 5% of performers and don’t be inactive.  Maximum inactivity is two weeks.  We have high hopes that you will want to help the guilds be a success and contribute even if you don’t have to.  

We create a ranking report every week immediately after the trader flips.  The report is usually available late on Tuesday night.

We use your weighted rank (explained below in Calculating Performance) to determine your rank among other members.  The weighted average allows for some ups and downs in performance, but not inactivity.  We do factor in adjustments if you have been with the guild for less than 3 weeks.
Your income earned may be achieved in a combination of several ways. 

1.  Income from your sales.  The guild does NOT get 7% of your sales.  ZOS takes half and leaves the rest for the guild and it is nearly impossible for any trading guild to pay for a weekly trader from sales income alone.  If you would like to know how to begin selling, check this document Basics of Selling
2. Gold donations made directly into the guild bank are counted 100% toward your earned income.  If you need help on how to make a donation, check this document Guild Basics.
3. Item donations of value made directly into the guild bank are greatly appreciated and you do get income credit for items of value.  Please note that we do not wish for you to put worthless items into the guild bank, as it does not give you credit for anything and creates more work for us to keep the bank space available for those that do wish to help.
4.  We hold One lottery every week (a big one called the Monster Lottery). The guild donates large amounts into these lotteries and the Monster lottery can have a jackpot from 1 to 6 million!  If you would like to know how to participate in this lottery, check [[Guild Lotteries]] (Currently at [Guild News](Guild-News.md))
5.  Guild Credits can be earned by all members. They are basically a form of guild currency that you can earn by holding a job, leading an event, making a donation of gold or donating items of value or passing the [Rite of Passage](Rite-of-Passage.md).  10,000 Guild Credits is equivalent to earning about $285,700 in sales and they can be quite lucrative.

## Calculating Performance
We measure performance by the guild rankings.  The guild ranking reports are published after trader flip on every Tuesday evening.  The ranking is a weighted average of two important indicators, 1. Your performance for the most current week reported, 2. Your historical performance.

Everyone’s rank is sorted from high to low.  The person with the highest number is the top person for the week and the bottom 5% will probably be removed unless they already made arrangements for a deposit to be made or have communicated special circumstances to an officer.
We also include pages that show sales ranks, performance for the most current week, 4 weeks and historical, donators, cumulative income and how guild credits are counted.

## Expectations

We hope that everyone will do their part for the whole.  But what is the whole?
It is the whole cost of operating the guild.  No one takes any money or items for personal use from our guilds - ever.  Many guilds take 10% and much more for the work that is required.  When we say the whole cost of operating the guild, the only thing discretionary is awards or prizes that are given to the members.  Therefore if someone does not pay their part, then we either close our doors or someone else must pay for every person that does not.

How much is your part?  Right now, we are saying that this amount is (25k per week St Elsweyr, 20k per week St Greymoor, 15k per week St Blackwood) in income from all income sources and we call it your fair share.  To be honest, the number is too low but we would be very happy if this amount would be met by everyone.  How much do you need to make in sales to cover 25k income?  We round it down to 700k.

Is this a requirement?  No. You can make a lot more if you want to. You can also make less, but please know that you are hurting the guild if you don’t make an alternative contribution to compensate.

There are several sources of income beside sales and indefinite combinations of those income sources.  We have a calculator that will allow you to play with the right combinations for you.  See the Contribution Calculator link in the sidebar.

## A Word about Guild Credits
You may be thinking that guild credits are like funny money.  Well all of the game money is funny money, but it is very real to each of us and the Guild environment.  If you owe me 10k in gold and you did something for me like writing a document about performance.  I could tell you that I will take off 1k gold in what you owe me for doing the document and then you would only owe me 9k.  

What would you call that 1k?  I would say that you were paid in the same manner as currency, but it went to pay off your debt.  It is the same way with guild credits.  They are paid in the same manner as currency, but they are part of the calculation in performance and they do improve your ranking.

The ranking report shows how guild credits are factored into your current week's performance. If you make a donation of $10,000 or earned $10,000 in credits, we count it as if you made $285,714 in sales for each one or the equivalent of .
