### Guild Philosophy 

Always remember you are playing with real people - Don’t hide behind a screen \
Everyone deserves the same respect and friendliness that you want \
We are all capable and worthy people \
Help others become the best they can be \
We are here to have fun \
Be adults with maturity, but let the kid inside shine  \
Dwell in an environment of trust  

## Simply Stated [Guild Rules](Guild-Rules.md)

The rules apply to **everyone** and they are enforced.

We wish we did not have to have rules and hope that someday we can throw them away, but until  that day: Learn them, respect them and enforce them. 

**We enforce the [Bethesda Code of Conduct](https://bethesda.net/en/document/code-of-conduct)**\
            **AND** we only use language that is used in the game dialog.

More detail, mostly about guild chat and discord chat can be found in [Guild Rules](Guild-Rules.md).

## What we need from you

We have no requirements other than to NOT fall into the bottom 5% of your peers in contributions and be active in the game.  

Learn about your guild and go through the [[Rite of Passage]]   \
Uphold our guild philosophy and rules \
Take advantage of our documentation and training \
Participate in events \
Lead events \
Stay active in the game but if real life temporarily forces you away, know how to do it right ([Absences](Absences.md))  \
Volunteer a little time to help others or the guild \
Always keep spirits high! 

## To us, performance is doing your part for the whole.  
It is friendliness,  \
it is helpfulness,  \
it is sales,  \
it is donations,  \
it is time, \
It is spirit, \
It is listening  . . . It is caring about the whole.  

# Requirements for our Trading Guilds

We are not like most guilds.  We set the standards low and hope you will overachieve because you want to and not because you are forced. ** We don’t have any requirements - except stay out of the bottom 5% of your peers in supporting the guild and don’t be inactive.**  Maximum inactivity is two weeks, and you must not go two weeks without making any sales.  We have high hopes that you will want to help the guilds be a success and contribute even if you don’t have to because you know it is needed for success.   

We create a ranking report every week immediately after the trader flips.  The report is usually available late on Tuesday night.

St Elsweyr and St Greymoor use your **weighted income average** (explained in [[Performance Guidelines]]) to determine your rank among other members.  The weighted average allows for ups and downs but not inactivity.  We do factor in adjustments if you have been with the guild for less than 4 weeks.

### Your income earned may be achieved in a combination of several ways.

1.  Income from your sales.  The guild does NOT get 7% of your sales.  ZOS takes half and leaves the rest for the guild and it is nearly impossible for any trading guild to pay for a weekly trader from sales income alone.  If you would like to know how to begin selling, check the [Sales Handbook](Sales-Handbook.md)
2. Gold donations made directly into the guild bank are counted 100% toward your earned income.  If you need help on how to make a donation, check this document: (Guild Basics)[Guild-Basics]
3. Item donations **of value** made directly into the guild bank are counted 100% toward your earned income, if a single item has a value of 1,000 gold or greater or if stackable items have a combined value of 1,000 gold or more.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Please note that we do not wish for you to put worthless items into the guild bank, as it does not give you credit for anything and creates more work for us to keep the bank space available for those that do wish to help.</span>
4. The 24 Hour Rule for Selling: If a listing has not sold in 24 hours, and it is not unique, unusual, or a traditionally hard to sell item (furnishings, motifs, non-meta weapons and armor, etc), please consider relisting the item and lowering the price. Please limit your "hard to sell" items to 5 slots or less." 

> While this is a good "rule of thumb" to follow at all times, the 24 hour rule will not be  declared unless we're in a pretty bad slump, or a pricing check shows that a load of our listed items are **WAY** out of line (I'm talking 50 to several thousand percent over TTC's highest suggested price - and, yes, there have been some items listed that had prices that would open your eyes. I do try to explain why when I declare that rule active. 

If you ever have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - either on Discord in Sales or via PM to @SidewaysJoe.


## Expectations

We hope that everyone will do their part for the whole. But what is the whole?

It is the entire cost of operating the guild. **No one takes any money or items from our guilds for personal use - ever.**  Many guilds take 10% to 20% and even more for the work that is required. When we say the whole cost of operating the guild, the only thing discretionary is awards or prizes that are given to the members. If someone does not pay their part, then we lose money and that requires someone else to pay for every person that does not. Why would we want to keep a member that costs us money or does not care if we succeed?

How much is your part?  We are saying that this amount is 20k per week in income from all income sources and we call it your Fair Share.  To be honest, the number is too low but we would be very happy if this amount would be met by everyone.  How much do you need to make in just sales to cover 20k income?  We round it down to 500k. (Editor's question: Is it still 500k?)

Is this a requirement?  No, it is not.  You can make a lot more if you want to. \
You can also make less, but please know that you are hurting the guild if you don’t make an alternative contribution like a donation to compensate.

There are many combinations of ways to make income besides sales alone.  We have a calculator that will allow you to play with the right combinations for you. ([Contribution Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18EE3hyYQJPFLcVFTjxABhpEym1-dqKtglReXqezndN0/edit?usp=sharing))

Also, don’t forget to buy a lottery ticket (BIG Payouts) The Monster lottery can have a jackpot from 1 to 6 million! If you would like to know how to participate in our lottery, check [[Guild Lotteries]]

## New Members 

The sales amounts may seem overwhelming but we can easily teach you how to make millions. Read our [Guild Basics](Guild-Basics.md) and please start selling right away.  Read our  to get better at sales and please ask any one of our friendly members for tips on learning to learn to sell BIG.  

New members have a temporary probation period where we do expect you to make an effort in selling.  Zero sales within your first or second week is not acceptable.

## Conclusion
How much did you learn? \
Want to find out if you can answer the basic questions that we hope you now know?  \
There is no pass or fail here - it is multiple choice and you can’t move to the next question until you pick the correct answer.  You can take the quiz as many times as you want.  There is no grading and the only thing we know is if you took the test or not.
