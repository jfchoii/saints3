(EN: Consider merging [Guild Basics](Guild-Basics.html))

Your first accomplishment is that you made it this far in the documentation!  Keep up the good effort!  

## Step 1 - Learn where the knowledge and communication is located

We have two communication and knowledge hubs to choose from:

1. Discord - No interaction is required.  You do not need headsets nor are you required to talk.  Discord is actually easier, more fun with more enjoyable content.  [Join now by clicking this link] (https://discord.gg/BvsTpQKhrF)   
Or, first learn about Discord and then join:  Discord Overview
1. Non-Discord - Go to this link in your browser: (tiny.one/allsaints) and you will be greeted with a table of contents that will link you to all guild and game information, guidelines, helpful information and the latest news that is updated weekly.

Once you have access to the information, then your journey begins.


## Step 2 - Read, Learn and ACT
We recommend that all members read though our Guild Handbook and if you are a completely new beginner to trading guilds that you start with Guild Basics.

We want you to be successful and we care deeply about you as a person and your level of enjoyment in the guild and game.


If you need help with selling, we recommend that you carefully read our [Sales Handbook](Sales-Handbook.md).  Do your best to learn and grow.  We can help you, which is explained in the [Guild Handbook](Guild-Handbook.md).

Stay informed by reading the [Guild News](Guild-News.md).  Updates are usually made by the end of every Tuesday.  The Ranking reports, lottery results, events and awards are also linked in the News also and for non-discord members, every update is published in the in-game MOTD (Message of the day)!

Act by starting to sell, making gold and rewarding yourself with meeting the challenge of progression.


## Step 3 - Growth as a Member

Progression is a step by step process where you become more informed, more skilled and ultimately a thriving member of the community and you are increasing your income earned.

All new and learning members begin with the rank of Page and progress to Squire, Crusader and then to a Knight where you will become an established & self-sustaining member.  Higher ranks for established members are achievable for those that choose to excel to a Paladin or the ultimate status of Lord.

We have no minimum sales or donations but your initial ability to stay in the guild and your progression as a new member is timed as we have a limited amount of openings for the ranks of Page, Squire and Crusader.  This timed progression is based entirely on how many new applicants want to join the guild and it should take about one week.  Established members have no timed limitations. 

Your growth and progression to each new rank is based on your total INCOME that you earn and can be a combination of several things:  Sales, Gold Donations, Item Donations, Lottery purchases and credits for jobs done for the guild.  We rate your income based on Fair Share.

Your Fair Share is only HALF of the cost of running the guild divided by 500 members.  Each guild has a different Fair share because the trader costs are significantly different.

St Elsweyr Fair Share is $25,000 of income per member\
St Greymoor Fair Share is $20,000 of income per member\
St Blackwood Fair Share is $15,000 of income per member

You need to ultimately progress to the rank of a knight which is the first rank that actually achieves Fair Share.

Page Fair Share is learning to reach 25% of Fair Share in one week\
Squire Fair Share is learning to reach 50% of Fair Share\
Crusader is learning to reach 75% of Fair Share.\
Knight is reaching 100% of Fair Share.

As new members come into the guild, the pages are removed first by the lowest Fair Share percent less than 25%.  Pages that have reached 25% or greater are promoted to a Squire.  Squires that have reached 50% or greater are promoted and Crusaders that have reached 75% are promoted.  Please note that you can be demoted if you fall below these percentages.  However, once you have reached the status of Knight, your income history is weighted into the percent and you will have more lead way before being demoted.
 
## Step 4 - Stay Active
Never become inactive without making a donation equal to your Fair Share % to hold your place in the guild OR send a message to an officer or GM as to why you cannot.  If you play the game in the offline mode - the game will count you as being absent every day and we have no way of knowing that you are not absent, so be sure to switch your offline status to being online every two week for at least 2 minutes.
