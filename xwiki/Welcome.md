### New Members
A warm welcome to you, friend! We are very happy you have joined us and we look forward to enjoying the game and guilds with you.

You may be curious about a lot of things and we have a step by step guide to help you transition into your new community.

### Overview

We highly recommend that you learn about your new guild.  We do things differently than most guilds and hope you will soon experience the benefits.

Progression is a step by step process where you become more informed, more skilled and ultimately a thriving member of the community and earning gold.

With you in mind, we have created a Step by Step Guide for you to follow to help your progression to be  fun and challenging.
