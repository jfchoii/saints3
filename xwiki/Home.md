# Don't edit this! Welcome to the saints wiki! 

Access this wiki at https://github.com/jfchoii/saints2/wiki

This is currently being edited by @pangiokuhlii.

This may be the home for static information related to the guild. Information that is constantly updated may be links to sheets/docs.

Planned and suggested edits:
1. Import contents of Google docs into wiki
2. Find a nice theme
3. (Need help with this) Host images offsite (Imgur or other) for linking in the pages 
4. Restore formatting where relevant (Like in [[Crown Exchange]], for example)
5. Restructure documentation to emphasize trading help and assistance (addons, pricing, farming, flipping, crafting, etc)
6. Find hosting so that we don't have to use the current URL tied to my github
7. Edit text so it is less verbose and easy for members to read and navigate
8. Remove redundant information, consolidate information
9. Hype up the guild lottery & rewards for donations
10. Find a way to make this document more private. Otherwise, more private info may be linked as static google docs.(Guild News)


# Introduction

## To New Members
A warm welcome to you, friend! We are very happy you have joined us and we look forward to enjoying the game and guilds with you.

You may be curious about a lot of things and we have a step by step guide to help you transition into your new community.

We highly recommend that you learn about your new guild. We do things differently than most guilds and hope you will soon experience the benefits.

Progression is a step by step process where you become more informed, more skilled and ultimately a thriving member of the community and earning gold.

With you in mind, we have created a [[Step by Step Guide]] for you to follow to help your progression to be fun and challenging.
