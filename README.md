# To New Members

A warm welcome to you, friend! We are very happy you have joined us and we look forward to enjoying the game and guilds with you.

You may be curious about a lot of things and we have a step by step guide to help you transition into your new community. We highly recommend that you learn about your new guild. We do things differently from most guilds and hope you will soon experience the benefits.

With you in mind, we have created a [Step by Step Guide](/wiki/Step-by-Step-Guide.md) and [in-game Guild Basics Guide](/wiki/Guild-Basics.md) for you to follow to help your progression to be fun and challenging.

> For Editors: You can edit the markdown files directly in the github.com interface without having to install anything, but **do not change the filenames** or links will break. 
> To edit, navigate to <https://github.com/jfchoii/saints3/tree/master/wiki> and open the .md file of interest. You can then edit it by clicking the :pencil: icon in the upper right side. This uses the Markdown format employed by Jekyll. [1](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/) [2](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
> 
> When saving the edits, select "Create new branch for this commit and start a pull request" -- this enables the admin (currently me) to approve edits before they are merged into the master branch (which the site reads from). You can continue editing pages within the same branch you created.
