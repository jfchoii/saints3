## To New Members

A warm welcome to you, friend! We are very happy you have joined us and we look forward to enjoying the game and guilds with you.

You may be curious about a lot of things and we have a step by step guide to help you transition into your new community.

We highly recommend that you learn about your new guild. We do things differently than most guilds and hope you will soon experience the benefits.

Progression is a step by step process where you become more informed, more skilled and ultimately a thriving member of the community and earning gold.

With you in mind, we have created a [Step by Step Guide](/wiki/Step-by-Step-Guide.md) and in-game [Guild Basics](/wiki/Guild-Basics.md) Guide for you to follow to help your progression to be fun and challenging.

#### Editor's notes -- members can stop reading here


Access site at https://jfchoii.github.io/saints2 ; Access this wiki at https://github.com/jfchoii/saints2/wiki

This may be the home for static information related to the guild. Information that is constantly updated may be links to sheets/docs.

Planned and suggested edits:
1. Import contents of Google docs into wiki
   - missing: Rite, Guild Home, Performance Guidelines, but may be consolidated into others?
2. Find a nice theme -- this one has too much manual declaring in the sidebars and links. Try to port to readthedocs Alabaster or mkdocs.
3. (Need help with this) Compile all images and upload to assets folder for linking in the pages 
4. Restore formatting where relevant (Like in [[Crown Exchange]], for example)
5. Restructure documentation to emphasize trading help and assistance (addons, pricing, farming, flipping, crafting, etc)
6. Find hosting so that we don't have to use the current URL tied to my github
7. Edit text so it is less verbose and easy for members to read and navigate
8. Remove redundant information, consolidate information
   - Guild Handbook and Rules may be redundant? 
   - Absences being separate from rules might be redundant but might also be OK because people might ask a lot
   - Emphasize contributions
9. Hype up the guild lottery & rewards for donations
10. Find a way to make this document more private. Otherwise, more private info may be linked as static google docs.(Guild News)

By using the remote functionality you can automatically keep your wiki always updated with latest features from the **git-wiki-theme**, but you can also fully customize it. 

- [git-wiki](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki): This is the documentation repository and website of the **git-wiki-theme** project. You would have not fork it unless you want to contribute to the git-wiki project documentation.
